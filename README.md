# Jewish calendar 
In our project app "Jewish calendar " we choose 2 features :
* 1. Check jewish events in year/month -displaying dates and titles allow to the jewish year events.
* 2. Convert Gregorian date to Jewish date
* we worked with TDD's attitude,that the features we coded after the test cases was tested.
